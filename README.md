# TeamHenklerTemplates



## For the students

### Before you ask about Overleaf
We do not support Overleaf, therefore refrain from asking questions about it. The template for the thesis compiles, but the free version is limited and might not be enough to handle it, especially as you expand your work with figures, graphs etc. We expect students to use latex on local machines ( [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org), [Visual studio code integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) ) and use GitHub for version-control. 

### The chapter's name can be changed
Ultimately, you should decide the flow of your thesis. 


## Other stuff
If you have a problem with the latex template, please write an email to luca.brodo@hshl.de
